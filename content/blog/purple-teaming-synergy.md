## What is Purple Teaming?

Purple Teaming is a collaborative approach where red teams (attackers) and blue teams (defenders) work together to improve an organization's overall security posture. Instead of operating in silos, they share insights and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in real-time or near real-time.

## Key Benefits of Purple Teaming

-   **Improved Detection & Response:** Blue teams gain a better understanding of attack vectors and can fine-tune detection mechanisms.
-   **Enhanced Red Team Effectiveness:** Red teams get immediate feedback on which TTPs are detected and which are missed, allowing them to refine their approaches.
-   **Better Security ROI:** Helps prioritize security investments based on observed gaps and successes.
-   **Knowledge Transfer:** Facilitates continuous learning and skill development for both teams.

## Core Concepts

-   **Collaborative Exercises:** Jointly planned and executed exercises.
-   **Open Communication:** Sharing of tools, attack paths, and defensive measures.
-   **Continuous Feedback Loop:** Iterative process of testing, detecting, and improving.
