## Introduction to Red Teaming

Red Teaming involves simulating the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of real-world adversaries to test an organization's defenses. Unlike standard penetration tests that might focus on specific vulnerabilities, red teaming often has broader objectives, such as testing overall detection and response capabilities against a persistent threat.

## Objectives of Red Teaming

-   **Assess Detection & Response:** Evaluate how well the blue team and security controls identify and react to an attack.
-   **Identify Security Gaps:** Uncover vulnerabilities in technology, processes, and people.
-   **Train Defenders:** Provide realistic scenarios for the blue team to practice their skills.
-   **Test Assumptions:** Validate whether security controls and procedures work as expected.

## Common Red Team Methodologies

-   **Intelligence Gathering (Reconnaissance):** Collecting information about the target.
-   **Initial Compromise:** Gaining a foothold in the target environment.
-   **Persistence:** Maintaining access over time.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher levels of access.
-   **Lateral Movement:** Moving through the network to access other systems.
-   **Data Exfiltration/Objective Completion:** Achieving the simulated attack's goal.
